NFT collection - Crypto Devs

Smart Contract

We are using Ownable.sol from Openzeppelin which helps us manage the Ownership of a contract. Ownable also let transferOwnership from the owner account to a new one, andrenounceOwnership for the owner to relinquish this administrative privilege, a common pattern after an initial stage with centralized administration is over.

Also we are using an extension of ERC721 known as ERC721 Enumerable. ERC721 Enumerable helps you to keep track of all the tokenIds in the contract and also the tokensIds held by an address for a given contract.

To build the smart contract we are using Hardhat. Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment and framework designed for full stack development in Solidity.

Website

To develop the website we are using React and Next Js. React is a javascript framework which is used to make websites and Next Js is built on top of React.

First, We need to create a new next app. 

     - NFT-Collection
       - hardhat-tutorial
       - my-app

Execute these commands in the terminal

    cd my-app
    npm run dev
    
Our app is running on http://localhost:3000

Now lets install Web3Modal library(https://github.com/Web3Modal/web3modal). Web3Modal is an easy-to-use library to help developers add support for multiple providers in their apps with a simple customizable configuration. By default Web3Modal Library supports injected providers like (Metamask, Dapper, Gnosis Safe, Frame, Web3 Browsers, etc).



Our Crypto Devs NFT dapp is working!
